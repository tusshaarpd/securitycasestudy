# Building a GenAI-Powered Penetration Testing Tool for Application Security

## Assignment Title:

**Building a GenAI-Powered Penetration Testing Tool for Application Security**

---

## Section 1: Product Vision & Problem Statement

### Product Vision

To build an internal, AI-augmented penetration testing tool that accelerates security validation of web and mobile applications by automating reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploit simulation, and contextual reporting.

### Problem Statement

AppSec teams at Xkart face:

* Increasing application complexity
* Growing attack surfaces
* Limited bandwidth to manually test endpoints

Traditional tools lack adaptability and contextual awareness. There is a strong need for intelligent automation that mimics adversarial behavior while maintaining safety and accuracy.

### End Users

* **Red Teamers**
* **AppSec Engineers**
* **Security Analysts**

### Workflow Improvements

* Reduce manual effort
* Real-time context-aware scanning
* Auto-generated mitigation suggestions
* Streamlined evidence-based reporting

## Section 2: Architecture & Design

### High-Level Architecture

#### 1. AI Component Layer

* LLM Prompt Engine
* Fine-tuned Vulnerability Models
* Embedding Models for pattern matching

#### 2. Security Scanner Integration

* Burp Suite Pro API
* OWASP ZAP CLI/API
* Nuclei Plugins
* Custom Python Scripts

#### 3. Payload Generator & Test Runner

* AI-generated payloads
* Dynamic test execution engine

#### 4. Result Correlation & Visualization

* Centralized correlation engine
* AI-based triage and dashboard interface

#### 5. Logging & Audit Trail

* Timestamps, user actions, and purpose tags
* Integration with SIEM/SOAR systems

## Bonus: Sample GenAI Prompt Flow

### Scenario: SSTI Detection

**Prompt Example:**

```
You are a pen-testing assistant. Generate 5 payloads to detect SSTI in a Jinja2-based endpoint:
- URL: https://target.com/user/profile?name={input}
- Expression-based detection, no obvious keywords
```

**Expected Output:**

```json
[
  {"payload": "{{7*7}}", "expected_response_hint": "49"},
  {"payload": "{{'a'*5}}", "expected_response_hint": "aaaaa"},
  {"payload": "{{1234+0}}", "expected_response_hint": "1234"},
  {"payload": "{{config.items()[0]}}", "expected_response_hint": "Config key exposed"},
  {"payload": "{{self.__init__.__globals__['__builtins__']}}", "expected_response_hint": "Built-ins object"}
]
```

## Assumptions

1. Tool is for internal use only.
2. Existing use of Burp/ZAP/Nuclei.
3. Enterprise access to LLMs.
4. Mature DevSecOps pipeline.
5. AppSec team has red-teaming experience.
6. Strong security and compliance posture.
